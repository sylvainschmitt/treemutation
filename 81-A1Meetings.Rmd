## 11/02/2021 Sylvain's Kick-off

*NT, MH, & SS*

### Funding

* GPR (labex COTE + idex UB): audition 01/21, answer 03-06/21
* Currently enough for __2__ species this year

### Site

* __Regina__ 
    * 1 LiDAR in 2016 (ONF, see Fig. \@ref(fig:reginaMap) and Fig. \@ref(fig:\@ref(fig:reginaMap)))
    * Possibility of clearing for drone
    * Destructive sampling for tree rings? Coring individuals. **Ask ONF.**
    * Higher trees. Maybe not older but at least implying more cell divisions regarding mutations.
* __Paracou__
    * 4 LiDAR campaigns from 2004 to 2015 (Fig. \@ref(fig:paracouMap))
    * Proximity, easier to follow phenology and collect flowers and fruits

### Species

1. *Dicorynia guyanensis*
1. ...
1. *Eschweilera sp*

* _Sextonia rubra_: 
    * already sampled
    * Paracou
* _Dicorynia_: 
    * Paracou & Regina
    * flowering time? **Ask Natalia Norden and Jerome Chave for original data + Patrick Heuret for his shared article**
    * Suggestion: spot one already flowering before sampling
    * Check the phenology at the herbarium
* _Eschwerilera sp_: 
    * Parcou (small) and Regina (big)
* _Handoranthus sp_: 
    * published genosegmenmes (to read) but high variation
    * Regina
    * Need to be collected for flux cytometry
* _Caryocar sp_: 
    * Paracou (big)
    * many lianas
    * no self shading?

### Field work

* __Regina__
    * beginning of march
    * wood samples
    * drone
    * dry leaves of *Handoranthus sp* for flux cytometry from our favorite individuals and two other potential candidates
    * Sample (Big shot) *Eschweilera sp* for identification and gene pool attribution with Myriam's SSRseq experiment (results in spring)
* __Paracou__
    * _Dycorinia_ from interplots. **Ask Partick Heuret and Eric Nicolini.**
    
### Genomics

* Check flux cytometry confidence: plot second against first sampling for confidence envelope (Fig. \@ref(fig:fluxconfidence))
* choose what to sequence
* get in touch asap sequencing company
* High molecular DNA extraction at CNRGV
* Bionano with CNRGV
* PacBio for HiFi reads
